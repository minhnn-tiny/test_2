## Requirement Analysis

The primary requirement is to create a pomodoro timer that is both user-friendly and customizable. The timer should be accurate and reliable, with options for users to set their own work and break intervals. Notifications are essential to alert users when intervals end. The product should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a wide reach.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement the core timer functionality with start, stop, and reset features']
- ['P0', 'Allow users to set custom work and break intervals']
- ['P1', 'Provide notifications for interval completion']
- ['P1', 'Track and display completed pomodoro sessions']
- ['P2', 'Ensure the UI is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices']

## UI Design draft

The UI should have a clean and minimalistic design. The main screen will feature a large timer display with start, stop, and reset buttons. There will be settings options to customize work and break intervals. Notifications will be displayed as pop-ups or alerts. The design should be responsive to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarify if there are any specific integrations or additional features required beyond the basic pomodoro timer functionality.
